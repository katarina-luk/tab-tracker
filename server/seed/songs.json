    "lyrics":"I've always been the one to say the first goodbye\nHad to love and lose a hundred million times\nHad to get it wrong to know just what I like\nNow I'm falling\nYou say my name like I have never heard before\nI'm indecisive, but this time I know for sure\nI hope I'm not the only one that feels it all\nAre you falling?\nCenter of attentionYou know you can get whatever you want from me\nWhenever you want it, baby\nIt's you in my reflection\nNow I'm afraid of all the things you could do to me\nIf I would've known it, baby\nI would've stayed at home, 'cause I was doin' better alone\nBut when you said,Hello, I knew that was the end of it all\nI should've stayed at home, 'cause now there ain't no letting you go\nAm I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?\nOh no, I was doin' better alone\nBut when you said,Hello, I knew that was the end of it all\nI should've stayed at home, 'cause now there ain't no letting you go\nAm I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?\nI wonder when you go, if I stay on your mind\nTwo could play that game, but you win me every time\nEveryone before you was a waste of time\nYeah, you got me\nCenter of attention\nYou know you can get whatever you want from me\nWhenever you want it, baby\nIt's you in my reflection\nNow I'm afraid of all the things you could do to me\nIf I would've known it, baby\nI would've stayed at home, 'cause I was doin' better alone\nBut when you said,Hello, I knew that was the end of it all\nI should've stayed at home, 'cause now there ain't no letting you go\nAm I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?\nOh no, I was doin' better alone\nBut when you said,Hello, I knew that was the end of it all\nI should've stayed at home, 'cause now there ain't no letting you go\nAm I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?\nOoh, break my heart\nOoh, break my heart\nOoh\nAm I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?\nI would've stayed at home, 'cause I was doin' better alone\nBut when you said, Hello, I knew that was the end of it all\nI should've stayed at home, 'cause now there ain't no letting you go\nAm I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?\nOh no, I was doin' better alone\nBut when you said, Hello, I knew that was the end of it all\nI should've stayed at home, 'cause now there ain't no letting you go\nAm I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?",
